# Google Results
This project aims to replicate a typical Google search results page as closely as possible design-wise.

The purpose of this project was to extend beyond the [Google Homepage](https://github.com/daniel-moderiano/google-homepage) project and attempt to recreate a slightly more complex page using only HTML and CSS.
